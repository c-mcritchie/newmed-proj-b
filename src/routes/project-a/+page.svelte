            Planned obsolescence is the practice of designing products to be short-lived or to become obsolete after a certain period of time.
            This is done to encourage consumers to buy new products, and is a major contributor to the e-waste problem. An iphone updating to a new OS and slowing down is a common example of this.

        <p>This was created in photoshop, I used an image of someone holding an iphone, cut out the background, used the smudge tool to give the slowing effect.
            I cloned a picture of electronic trash and used the clone snap tool to add slight variation and blur the lines. </p>
